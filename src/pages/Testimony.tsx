            LLC is a place for growing and grooming believers into maturity
            through intentional teaching of the undiluted revelation of the
            Scripture. We believe that when Christ is unveiled, Saints are
            empowered. It is a place of equipping and empowering believers for
            the end time global harvest and also preparing saints for the age to
            come. We believe that our core responsibility is not to raise
            members but disciples.

           OLUWAKEMI BABATUNDE (Testimony of life Transformation) I'm this person that doesn't believe in the word of God because I don't see it come to reality in my life. Sometimes, I read the word of God that says 'for God knows the plans He has towards me' and I don't see any of His plans come to pass in my life but now I have come to the realisation that truly the word works. I used to believe that all marriages are the same, while growing up I decided I wasn't going to get married because I never saw a happy home and I didn't want that for myself. But my perspective about marriage changed when I met Pastor Juwon and Pastor Lade Owolabi. Spiritually I was not growing, I go to church but I wasn't burning for God. I couldn't pray for 1 hour but now I'm an Intercessor. Have grown in all areas of my life through the help of my Pastors.
